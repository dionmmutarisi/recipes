# CHIKAFU Recipes Generator

This is my app called "Chikafu", a Flask-based app with Gen AI integrations. The app creates new recipes based on te food items in the country you can either enter a specific cuisine, country or continent. 

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GeminiAPI

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write  *something* . If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

I made this APP using Flask, 

The backend is written in python

The frontent is written in html, css for styling and js for connecting frontend to backend.

## Optimizations

*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
