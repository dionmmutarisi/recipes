It\\'s warm, comforting, and surprisingly filling!\\n\\n**Cuisine:** American\\n**Serving:** 2\\n**Time:** 30 minutes\\n**Budget:** Low\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n*   4 slices of your favorite bread (sourdough, white, or hearty whole wheat work best)\\n*   1 cup cooked rice (leftover cooked rice is perfect!)\\n*   4-6 slices of salami, finely diced\\n*   1 cup shredded cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby, or a blend)\\n*   2-3 tablespoons butter (for grilling the bread)\\n*   1/2 cup fresh lettuce, shredded or torn\\n*   Salt and black pepper to taste\\n*   *Optional:* A pinch of garlic powder or onion powder for the rice mixture\\n\\n**Instructions (Approx. 25-30 minutes):**\\n\\n1.  **Prep the Filling (5-7 minutes):**\\n    *   In a medium bowl, combine the cooked rice, finely diced salami, and **half (1/2 cup)** of the shredded cheese.\\n    *   Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. If using, add a pinch of garlic powder or onion powder for extra flavor. Mix everything together well.\\n\\n2.  **Assemble the Pockets (5-7 minutes):**\\n    *   Generously butter one side of each of the four bread slices.\\n    *   Place two slices of bread, butter-side down, on a clean surface or cutting board.\\n    *   Sprinkle about **1/4 cup** of the *remaining* shredded cheese over each of these two unbuttered bread slices.\\n    *   Divide the rice-salami mixture evenly between these two slices, mounding it slightly in the center. Don\\'t overfill!\\n    *   Top the rice mixture with the last **1/4 cup** of shredded cheese, ensuring some cheese is on top of the rice to help bind and melt.\\n    *   Place the other two buttered bread slices on top, butter-side up, forming your two sandwiches.\\n\\n3.  **Grill the Pockets (10-12 minutes):**\\n    *   Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over **medium heat**.\\n    *   Carefully transfer the assembled grilled cheese pockets to the hot skillet.\\n    *   Cook for 4-6 minutes per side, or until the bread is beautifully golden brown and crispy, and the cheese inside is fully melted and gooey.
